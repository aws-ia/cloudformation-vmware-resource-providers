This resource type manages a VMware Cloud on AWS [Software Defined Data Centre (SDDC)][1]

## Prerequisites

* [AWS Account][2]
* [AWS CLI][3]

## AWS Management Console

To get started:

## Syntax and Properties Reference

For more details on how to structure a CloudFormation template that makes use of the VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC resource type, and the available properties, click [here][9].

## Examples

### Create an SDDC

First, add the VMware Cloud Access Token and Org ID as secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.

```Bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --name MyVMCOrg \
  --secret-string '{"AccessToken":"INSERTACCESSTOKEN","OrgID":"INSERTORGID"}'
```

Then use the following Cloudformation Template to create an SDDC:

```yaml
